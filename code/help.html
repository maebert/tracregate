        <h2>What the trac?</h2>
        <p><a href="http://trac.edgewall.org">trac</a> is an open-source collaboration software that combines a Wiki, file versioning and a ticketing system.
        If you're not using it (yet), this page is not for you (yet). <b>trac</b>regate is a client for any (even multiple) trac installation that aims to provide a modern, slick interface to trac's ticket system.</p>
        
        <h3>Why should I be using tickets?</h3>
        
        <p>Don't think of a ticket so much as a task, think of it as a workflow. If you want to start a workflow (that may involve a number of tasks), you open a ticket. From there, everything can happen - responsibilities change, things may have to be postponed, the workflow develops a life of it's own. The ticket helps you to keep track of what's happening.</p>
